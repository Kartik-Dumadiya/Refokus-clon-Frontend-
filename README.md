# 🖥️ Refokus Website Clone (Frontend)

This project is a **frontend clone** of the Refokus website, focusing on replicating its **design and animation** using **React**. It's all about creating smooth scrolling effects, dynamic animations, and a visually stunning UI.

## 🚀 Features

- **LocomotiveScroll**: For smooth, parallax-like scrolling across the website.
- **Framer Motion**: Used for animations such as:
  - Sliding video windows when hovering over components.
  - Infinite stripes and a continuously moving marquee.
- **useScroll & useMotionValueEvent**: To dynamically display content based on the user's scroll position, making the website more interactive and engaging.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **LocomotiveScroll**: For smooth scrolling and scroll-based effects.
- **Framer Motion**: For animations and dynamic UI transitions.
- **CSS/SCSS**: For styling and layout.

## 📚 What I Learned

- Implementing **scroll-based animations** with React using LocomotiveScroll and Framer Motion.
